# Summary

One reason that we might be seeing pattern 1 for so many policies is that they all started around the same time, so there was a massive spike in cases in the first month when a lot of these policies took effect then a leveling off. This would mean that the policy itself didn't cause the reduction in spread, rather, the policy in conjunction with other policies.

One major weakness of this study is that it only considers policies in isolation and does not account for the interactions with different policies.
