# Covid-19 Correlation Analysis
The objective of this project is to experiment with regression analysis and feature engineering to study how the COVID-19 responses might have affected new case and death numbers in the first year of the pandemic. 

Case and death data were sourced from the Johns Hopkins University's COVID-19 tracking project. Policy data was sourced from data.gov. 

The core of this project exists in a series of jupyter notebooks, which are organized as follows:

- 00: high-level overview of the methodology used and current results
- 01: Exploratory data analysis on case and death data
- 02: Exploratory data analysis on policy data
- 03: Making some basic plots (This notebook is mostly for posterity - I started this project shortly after I started learning python and these plots were one of the first things I tried to make)
- 04: checking the average change in cases and deaths 14 days after a policy was implemented
- 05: running the first round of linear regression models (single policy)
- 06: analyzing the results of the runs started in 05
