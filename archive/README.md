# covid-19-data-analysis
A study on how the COVID-19 responses might be affecting new case and death numbers.

Case and death data was sourced from the Johns Hopkins University's COVID-19 tracking project. Policy data was sourced from data.gov. 

There are 2 notebooks associated with this project: 

### 1) Covid-19 data analysis.ipynb

This is the main notebook associated with the project. It contains a brief discussion of data cleaning, plotting cases and deaths over time at the county, state, and national level, overlays with selected policy implementations, and a correlation between policies and changes in new case and death numbers. 

Policies were correlated with two key metrics in case and death numbers: the difference in new cases and deaths on the day of policy implementation and 14 days later, and the change in curvature of the new cases and new deaths plot- which I refer to as the 'acceleration' of new cases and new deaths.

### 2) Covid-19 data cleaning.ipynb

This is the detailed column-by-column data cleaning process that went into preparing the Covid-19 data analysis notebook, including a detailed analysis of invalid datapoints.
